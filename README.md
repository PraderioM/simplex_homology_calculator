This program can be used to compute homology groups of any simplicial complex given its maximal faces.
To use the program simply execute the main script and select an input and output file.
Input files must contain the maximal faces separated by either semicolons ';' or line breaks faces
must follow the format '(v_{1},\dots,v_{n})' where v_{i} is a strictly positive integer indicating the
number of all vertexes contained in the face.
